<p> Female rappers are the embodiment of modern female empowerment. They take control of their own bodies and sexualities. As the songs prove, no man is going to limit their potential or tell them what to do in any way; instead they are the ones conquering everyone around them with cool ease. They are not the ones begging, but the ones being worshipped. One word, one calculated slip of skin and the world falls to their feet. It is the subtle almost everyday insurrection against patriarchical structures deeply embedded into our society that should draw our attention. Not the curse words nor the sexual innuendos. With this newfound female confidence this refusal to back down and make theself smaller, they set off a revolution every single day. Solely their way of existing is enough to set off this chain of action.
In times of WAP and onlyfans female empowerment seems to reach its zenith; but the truth is there is still a long way to go, if one actually wants to put an end to sexist world views, harassment, violence and oppression. Even the prior mentioned milestones are sullied with disgust and abuse by a major part of the population. So being a new coined "hot girl" is a major accomplishment. It is a unspoken committment to self love, righteousness, equality and obviously being majorly hot.

As Megan thee Stallion said: <a href:https://youtu.be/jAIqPB8r8no>Ah. Just kidding she also said realhotgirlshit<</a> So another January outlook is probably the realization of the power within a hotgirl and the newfound strive to become one.:) </p>
